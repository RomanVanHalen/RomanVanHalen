### 🧠 Who Am I?

I'm a **SOC Analyst** with a strong foundation in threat detection, incident response, and log analysis — backed by hands-on experience simulating real-world attacks in lab environments. I dive deep into both sides of the security coin: defending systems and understanding how adversaries operate.

> _"We are not fighting against flesh and blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world."_ — Ephesians 6:12
